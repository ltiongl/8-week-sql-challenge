### Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi

## A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    plan_name,
    start_date,
    price
FROM
    plans 
        JOIN
    subscriptions USING (plan_id);
```

The is just a part of the table. There is a total of 2650 rows in the table.

## B. Data Analysis Questions

### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
```sql

FROM
    plans 
        JOIN

## C. Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

```sql
WITH cte_1 AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        plan_id,
        plan_name,
        start_date,
        price AS amount,
        LEAD(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS cutoff_date
    FROM 
        subscriptions 
            JOIN
        plans USING (plan_id)
    WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2020 AND plan_name NOT IN ('trial', 'churn')),
cte_2 AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        plan_id,
        plan_name,
        start_date,
        COALESCE(cutoff_date, '2020-12-31') cutoff_date, 
        amount
    FROM cte_1)
SELECT * FROM cte_2;
```
